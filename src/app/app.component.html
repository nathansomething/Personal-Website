    <p>
      I am a Full Stack Software Developer with Quality Assurance experience located in Troy, New York. I was born and raised in Portland Oregon and obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University in Boston Massachusetts. Following college, I returned to my hometown where I married my then 7-year girlfriend and love of my life. We then moved to Troy, where she's pursuing a Ph.D. in biology at RPI.
    </p>

      My interest in software development goes all the way back to middle school. In 6th grade, I joined my school's FLL Lego Robotics team, where I was first exposed to programming. I loved being able to use code as a tool to solve problems, and I've always been amazed at how a bit of text on a screen can be compiled and brought to life. I also picked up a book on HTML in the seventh grade and taught myself the basics of web design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in love with robotics and programming, I joined my high school’s FRC team as a Freshman. Although I loved getting to learn about the mechanical and electrical parts of the robot, I confirmed that my true passion was programming. I was on the programming team from Sophomore through Senior year and was the team leader during my Senior year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robotics had taught me the basics of logic and C++, but I wanted to learn more. Unfortunately, my high school didn't offer any programming classes, so I took two introductory computer science classes at Portland Community College. These skills paved the way for my first internship during my senior year of high school at Vernier Software and Technology.
    </p>

      At Northeastern, I grew immensely both as a programmer and as an individual. My coursework challenged me, introduced me to new perspectives, and opened my mind to new possibilities. My classmates inspired me and pushed me to become my best self. After crawling out of my shell a bit, I discovered the energy of Boston and its thriving tech community. I loved attending lectures, hackathons, and meetups all around the city. During my time at Northeastern, I had three internships, totaling around 20 months of work experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to Computer Science, I also obtained minors in History and Russian Studies.  I find learning about the past both interesting and informative. In order to truely understand something, you first have to understand how it came about. I've been speaking Russian as a second language for many years now, and hope to someday become fluent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, I love cooking, board games, and role-playing games. I love being around nature and when the weather is nice (or sometimes even when it's not!) I love going hiking or camping with my wife and my dog. I also love traveling and exploring new places.
